## ❓ FAQ

### Why is it an app and not a website?

Technical issues with using third-party websites/APIs can be bypassed with a native desktop application. Alternatively, I could run a server, but I ain't paying for that. The Electron app allows us to bypass CORS restrictions and access APIs that would otherwise be blocked in a browser.

### Windows SmartScreen Warning

If you see a Windows SmartScreen warning when installing, this is a standard issue with unsigned applications. Google it if you're worried - it's just Windows being cautious about apps that aren't code-signed. The application is safe to use.

## 🎯 Overview

Omni Screen is a downloadable desktop application built for the Destiny.gg community. The application is designed as a native client to bypass CORS restrictions from various backends, enabling seamless integration of multiple services and features.
